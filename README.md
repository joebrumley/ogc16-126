# er_template
This is a template proposed for OGC Release Notes.  The objective is for editors to check this out (Clone a version) and begin editing it with a tool such as AsciidocFX.

Note that the file index.adoc should not be modified, but you should begin with rn.adoc. The file rn.adoc has some metadata information and a list of includes from the list of files below. NOTE:  The includes in the first group below should not need to be adjusted (just modify the file as necessary).  You will need to modify the include statements of the clauses-examples as stated below and potential remove or add annexes. All documents should include the history and bibliography so these includes should not be changed (edit the files as required).

* rn.adoc
  * clause-0-preface.adoc
  * clause-1-intro.adoc
  * clause-2-references.adoc
  * clause-3-terms.adoc
  * clause-4-change-log.adoc
  * clause-5-critical.adoc
  * clause-6-substantive.adoc
  * clause-7-future.adoc

  * clauses-examples.adoc  == use as many clause sections as necessary.  Number as clause-07.adoc, clause-08.adoc, etc.
 
  * annex-a.adoc  --|
  * annex-b.adoc    |-- Use as needed
  * annex-c.adoc  --|
 
  * annex-history.adoc
  * annex-bibliography.adoc
